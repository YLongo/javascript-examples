<p class="about-us">
    we have built partnerships with small farms around the world to source the best possible ingredients for our teas. We work closely with these farms to both ensure the quality of the ingredients we source and to have a positive impact on these communities.
    we then take these high-quality ingredients and carefully craft them into delicious teas that are both healthy and full of flavor. All of our teas are certified organic and kosher, and we use 100% biodegradable packaging because we want to be as sustainable as possible.
